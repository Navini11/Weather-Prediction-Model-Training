# Weather Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of predicting weather conditions using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to build a model that can forecast weather based on historical data.

## Contents

- **predict_weather.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, explanations, and visualizations for the weather prediction project.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd weather-prediction
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook predict_weather.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the notebook cells to train the weather prediction model and visualize the results.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
- **Model Training**: Different machine learning models are trained, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: The results of the predictions are visualized using plots to better understand the model's performance.
